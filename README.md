# Project "Image Recommender"
## DAISY course 4th semester "Big Data Engineering"
### Software:

Functional requirements:

The final Python software should be able to perform the following actions:
Basic requirement (enough to pass the module):

• For a single input image: Find the 5 best matching images from the provided dataset
(about 500,000 images) based on at least three different similarity measures. The
search should take no longer than a few seconds.

Additional requirements:

• Combine metrics:
Find the 5 best matches just as before, but now with respect to 2-3 input images
(instead of just one). You can also combine two different distance metrics if you
want (optional).

• Use an approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm (external library or own
implementation?)
